Wrote this personal project to add my hockey games automatically to my google calendar.

I usually manually add them to my calendar, which has caused an issue on at least 2 occasions:
  1. Once I added the wrong time and showed up to the rink when my game had 3 minutes left. I live and die by my calendar, and was pretty crushed to have missed a game I was excited to play in
  2. Once I added a game that didn't exist by mistake. Luckily I realized this before I managed to go the rink for a phantom game

I'm working on a potential career switch into software and trying to learn via interesting projects that are functional to me. What's better than automating something that I usually do manually and with mistakes?

It took me a bit to figure out how to get the google API to work and tbh don't remember 100% of what I did. Note for next time: document that stuff better
